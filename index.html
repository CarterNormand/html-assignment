            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Carter Normand. I have a couple of passions, but other than that I'm boring. That's because the passions I do have, I'm obsessed about. So I put all of my time and effort into them. My first and main passion is basketball. I started playing 6 years ago and still love it the same now as I did day one. I actually play college basketball here at Algonquin, which is a dream come true.</p>
            <p2>My second passion is sports videography and filmmaking. I got into it around the same time as basketball and have worked with many pro sports teams in Ottawa. The most recent team is the Ottawa 67's, in which I am making a docuseries for them to pitch to a service to pick it up. It's all about the behind the scenes of being a top level athlete, which is my bread and butter as a filmmaker.</p2>
